# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Multi-Point Selection and Bulk Operations
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add ability to select multiple points using keyboard modifiers and perform bulk editing operations with project-based persistence
# Details:
Extend graph interaction to support Ctrl+click and Shift+click for multi-selection. Implement selection rectangle with mouse drag. Add visual indicators for selected points (different color/border). Create bulk operations: delete selected, move selected, copy/paste. Implement keyboard shortcuts: Ctrl+A (select all), Delete (remove selected), Ctrl+C/V (copy/paste). Add selection state to XState machine. Create context menu for right-click operations. Ensure all bulk operations are saved to project data with proper edit history tracking.

# Test Strategy:
Test multi-selection with various keyboard combinations. Verify bulk operations work correctly. Test copy/paste functionality. Validate keyboard shortcuts across different operating systems. Verify bulk changes are properly tracked in project edit history.
