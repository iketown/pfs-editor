# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement Video-Graph Synchronization System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Create real-time synchronization between video playback position and graph cursor with frame indicator using project data
# Details:
Create lib/synchronization.ts with sync logic. Implement video timeupdate event handler that updates graph cursor position. Add vertical line indicator on graph showing current video time. Create bidirectional sync: video seeks update graph, graph clicks seek video. Use XState for synchronization state machine with states: idle, playing, seeking. Handle edge cases like rapid seeking and playback rate changes. Implement debouncing for smooth performance. Integrate with project system to maintain synchronization state per project.

# Test Strategy:
Test synchronization accuracy with frame-by-frame video stepping. Verify cursor position updates during playback. Test rapid seeking scenarios. Validate performance during continuous playback. Test project-based synchronization state persistence.
