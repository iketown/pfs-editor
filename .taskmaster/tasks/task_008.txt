# Task ID: 8
# Title: Add Drag-and-Drop Point Editing to Graph
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement interactive editing functionality allowing users to drag position points on the graph with project-based persistence
# Details:
Extend FSGraph component with Chart.js drag plugin. Implement mouse event handlers: onMouseDown, onMouseMove, onMouseUp. Add point selection logic with visual feedback (highlight selected points). Implement drag constraints (position 0-100, time boundaries). Update Funscript data in real-time during drag operations. Add hover effects and cursor changes. Implement touch support for mobile devices. Create undo/redo system using command pattern. Automatically save changes to project data and maintain edit history.

# Test Strategy:
Test drag functionality across different browsers. Verify constraints prevent invalid values. Test undo/redo operations. Validate touch interactions on mobile devices. Test performance with multiple simultaneous drags. Verify changes are properly saved to project data.
