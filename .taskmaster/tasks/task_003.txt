# Task ID: 3
# Title: Build Video Upload and File Handling System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement project-based workflow with video file handling, funscript management, and browser-specific persistence for development workflow
# Details:
Create a project-based system where users can create projects with names, upload/select video files, and manage funscript files. Implement browser-specific file persistence: use File System Access API with IndexedDB for Chromium browsers, and traditional file input with session storage for Firefox/Safari. Projects should store video file references and funscript data, allowing users to reopen projects and automatically reload video and funscript content. Support MP4, WebM, OGV formats with file validation.

# Test Strategy:
Test project creation, saving, and loading across different browsers. Verify video file persistence in Chromium browsers across sessions. Test funscript file handling and project state restoration. Validate graceful degradation for non-Chromium browsers. Test error handling for unsupported formats and missing files.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create project data model and storage [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement project data structure with video file references, funscript data, and metadata. Create storage layer using localforage for project persistence
### Details:
Define Project interface with id, name, createdAt, videoFile reference, funscript data, and settings. Implement lib/project-storage.ts with CRUD operations using localforage. Handle browser-specific file reference storage (file handles for Chromium, file metadata for others).

## 2. Build project management interface [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create components for project creation, listing, and selection with a clean UI
### Details:
Implement components/ProjectManager.tsx with project list, create new project dialog, and project selection. Add project cards showing name, creation date, and preview. Include delete and rename functionality.

**LoaderContextView Component Added:**

Created `LoaderContextView` component following the same pattern as the existing `ContextView`:

1. **Component Location**: `src/components/fs_components/LoaderContextView.tsx`
2. **Features**:
   - Settings icon button in top-right corner
   - Dialog with project machine state and context display
   - Uses `react-json-tree` for formatted JSON viewing
   - Shows current state value and full context
   - Integrated with `LoaderActorContext` hooks

3. **Integration**: Added to main page (`src/app/page.tsx`) for debugging and monitoring

4. **Machine Fixes**: 
   - Fixed commented out `SELECT_VIDEO` target
   - Fixed relative target issue with `RESET` event
   - All transitions now use absolute targets for XState v5 compatibility

**Current Status**: The project workflow now has full debugging capabilities with real-time state monitoring through the context viewer.

XState v5 syntax has been corrected in the project workflow implementation. Fixed assign action destructuring from incorrect `(_, event)` to proper `({ event })` and `({ context, event })` patterns. Resolved duplicate provider issue that was causing "stopped actor" errors. Created comprehensive XState cursor rule documentation to prevent future syntax issues. The video file handling system now integrates properly with the corrected XState v5 project workflow state machine.
