# Title: Create Funscript Export and Download System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement functionality to export edited Funscript data as downloadable JSON files from project data
# Details:
Create lib/export.ts with exportFunscript function. Generate valid Funscript JSON with metadata (version, range, inverted). Implement browser download using Blob and URL.createObjectURL. Add export options: filename customization, metadata inclusion. Create export button in UI with download progress indicator. Validate exported data matches Funscript 1.0 specification. Add export history and recent files list in project data. Support exporting from current project or specific project versions.

# Test Strategy:
Test exported files can be re-imported successfully. Verify JSON structure matches Funscript specification. Test download functionality across browsers. Validate metadata preservation during export. Test exporting from different project versions.
